/**
 * @file distance.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of RSSI averaging and distance estimation utilities.
 *
 * This file provides definitions for global parameters and functions
 * that help smooth RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values
 * and estimate distance based on the log-distance path loss model.
 *
 * The algorithm uses exponential smoothing for RSSI and applies
 * the following formula for distance estimation:
 *
 * \f[
 *   d = 10^{\frac{(txPower - rssi)}{10 \cdot n}}
 * \f]
 *
 * where:
 * - \f$d\f$ is the estimated distance in meters,
 * - \f$rssi\f$ is the measured signal strength in dBm,
 * - \f$txPower\f$ is the RSSI at 1 meter reference distance,
 * - \f$n\f$ is the path-loss exponent.
